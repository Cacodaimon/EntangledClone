# EntangledClone
A D3.js based Entanglement clone written in TypeScript.

There is also a tutorial at my [blog](http://cacodaemon.de/index.php?id=67) about this project and a [running demo ](http://www.cacodaemon.de/demos/EntangledClone/)!

Use <kbd>←</kbd> or <kbd>→</kbd> for rotating the hexagon, <kbd>⏎</kbd> for placing and <kbd>space</kbd> for switching with the spare hexagon, but it has although touch support!

If you wants to build it yourself, install and run `grunt`.
